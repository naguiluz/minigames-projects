This will be a collection of little games and projects that I use to learn new things and cement my knowledge.

In "pong" I learned just that! How to program allthe various functions and variables in order to have a functioning game of pong. Lots of new skills with this one. I learned how to create and update text displays, create visual objects, moving objects, user inputs to control those objects, and adding sounds when certain parameters are met. Thanks so much to @TokyoEdTech for the great tutorial on freecodecamp's youtube. 3/19/2021

In my seaparte "connect4" files I first set up the board and the various functions for setting pieces and determining their locations, next I created a function for checking each piece to find out if a player has won the game. I next imported pygame in order to creaate the visual board and the spaces where the pieces will be placed. 3/23-3/26/21
